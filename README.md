# BELB-Working-Setup

This is a working setup for the Biomedical Entity-Linking Benchmark (BELB), including corpora such as medMentions, linnaeus, s800, ncbi_disease, and nlm_chem. This repository contains all the necessary steps to install and run BELB correctly across multiple corpora.

The original repositories (`belb` and `belb-exp`) can be found there without my configuration, and with instructions to do your own.

This configuration includes scripts to analyze results and datasets on a mention-level.

## Usage Instructions

### Downloading the KBs

You will first need to download the processed KBs here:

https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qDdQIhkGduWKGi-VrVn5aFOmQd3xDipd/view?usp=sharing

It's a 675MB archive that you will then need to unzip (2GB).

Unzip it in the following directory: `belb/processed/`

It should create a folder named `kbs`.

### Environment

#### Conda / Mini-conda

From the root, use the corresponding `.yml` file:

`conda env create -f belb-env-linux.yml`

or

`conda env create -f belb-env-macOS.yml` 

and then

`pip install -e belb/.`

`conda activate belb-env`

<br>

Alternatively, you can install it manually (recommended) by running:

`conda create -n belb-env python=3.9 -y`

`conda activate belb-env`

`pip install -r belb-exp/requirements.txt`

`pip install -e belb/.`

`pip install --force-reinstall pandas==1.4.1`

`pip install --force-reinstall numpy==1.26.4`

#### Venv

From the root, install it manually by running:

`python3 -m venv belb-venv`

`source belb-venv/bin/activate`

`pip install -r belb-exp/requirements.txt`

`pip install -e belb/.`

`pip install --force-reinstall pandas==1.4.1`

`pip install --force-reinstall numpy==1.26.4`

<br>

## Converting raw data to processed

All corpora and knowledge bases are already converted in this setup, and raw data is not included in the repository, but if you ever need to download some, they must be stored in:

`belb/raw/corpora/<corpora_name>` for corpora

or

`belb/raw/kbs/<kb_name>` for knowledge bases

<br>

To convert corpora, run from `belb-exp`:

`PYTHONPATH=../belb:. python -m belb.corpora.<corpora_name> --dir ../belb --db ../belb/db.yaml --pubtator ../belb/pubtator/pubtator.db --sentences`

Note that the argument `pubtator` is optional; not all corpora need it, but some do. Make sure to have the `pubtator.db` file in `belb/pubtator`.

<br>

To convert a knowledge base, run from `belb-exp`:

`PYTHONPATH=../belb:. python -m belb.kbs.<kb_name> --dir ../belb --data_dir ../belb/raw/kbs/<kb_name> --db ../belb/db.yaml`
 
<br>

The processed corpora and knowledge bases will be stored in:

`belb/processed/corpora/<corpora_name>` for corpora

or

`belb/processed/kbs/<kb_name>` for knowledge bases


### Running the benchmark

Edit the CORPORA list in `belb-exp/scripts/evaluate.p` to specify which corpora to include in the evaluation.

<br>

Then from `belb-exp` run:

`PYTHONPATH=../belb:. python scripts/evaluate.py --belb_dir ../belb --k 1 --mode std`

<br>

The argument `k` can take any integer value.

The argument `mode` can take the values `std`, `strict`, or `lenient`.

You can also add the argument `--full`.

<br>

Compute advanced metrics on predictions by first running from `belb-exp`:

`python3 metrics/annotate_preds.py --corpora <corpora_name>`

Add the argument `--force` to force the recomputation of the metrics. Otherwise, the script will try to pick them up from saved files.

You can change the threshold for most characteristics using the following args:

`--synonymy <int>`: number of synonyms to be considered a poorly annotated entity (default <= 10)

`--length <int>`: number of tokens to be considered a long mention (default > 10)

`--variation <int>`: variation to be considered a high lexical variation (default > 0.1)

`--frequency <int>`: frequency to be considered a rare entity or mention (default <= 10)

Then run the evaluation script with the argument `--advanced`.

Add the argument `--plot` to plot the metrics in `metrics/plots/`.

Add the arguments `--focus <characteristic_name>` and `--others <characteristic_name1> <optional_characteristic_name2> ...` to plot a specific continuous characteristic versus one or several discrete characteristics. Add the argument `--model` with these to choose a specific model to consider `(arboel, genbioel, or rbes)`, will consider all of them if not specified. The set of valid characteristic names is:

`mention_length`

`num_synonyms`

`num_homonyms`

`lexical_variation`

`mention_frequency`

`entity_frequency`

`zero_shot_entity`

`zero_shot_surface_form`

<br>

Analyze your dataset characteristics by running from `belb-exp`:

`python3 metrics/analyze_datasets.py --corpora <corpora_name>`

Add the argument `--force` to force the recomputation of the metrics. Otherwise, the script will try to pick them up from saved files.

You can change the threshold for most characteristics using the following args:

`--synonymy <int>`: number of synonyms to be considered a poorly annotated entity (default <= 10)

`--length <int>`: number of tokens to be considered a long mention (default > 10)

`--variation <int>`: variation to be considered a high lexical variation (default > 0.1)

`--frequency <int>`: frequency to be considered a rare entity or mention (default <= 10)


### Working corpora

✅ These corpora have been tested and verified to run correctly:

- s800
- medMentions
- linnaeus
- NCBI_disease (Warning: low performance, might suggest a corrupted corpora/KB)
- NLM_chem (Warning: low performance, might suggest a corrupted corpora/KB)

<br>

⚠️ The following corpora could not be processed due to data corruption or missing dependencies:

- bc5cdr_disease (corrupted zip file)
- bc5cdr_chemical (corrupted zip file)
- bioID (corrupted tar file)
- gnormplus (corrupted NCBI_gene KB)
- NLM_gene (corrupted NCBI_gene KB)
- SNP (requires dbSNP knowledge base)
- osiris (requires dbSNP knowledge base)
- tmVar (requires dbSNP knowledge base)


### Pubtator

Pubtator is a tool required by several corpora to convert to the BELB format. It consists of a 32GB archive, which is then processed into a 100GB SQLite database.

It is advised not to keep it locally (on your laptop, for instance) as it is very heavy and unnecessary unless you want to reconvert some corpora.

⚠️ It is not required to run the benchmark evaluation.


### dbSNP

dbSNP is a big knowledge base needed by a few corpora (with VARIANTS). It consists of an archive that is over 100GB, and then needs to be converted into a processed knowledge base that is probably over 700/800GB.

⚠️ It is not required to run the benchmark evaluation.
